## What is Modern.fm?

Modern.fm is an e-commerce platform for custom and pre-made piano loops. I co-founded Modern.fm with two fellow musicians.

I currently lead development on Modern.fm, serving as the Lead Developer and CTO. I developed a custom order management and e-commerce solution for the site, tailored specifically to the products we provide. In addition, I built an access portal for customers to access their orders, regardless of whether they are for custom or pre-made piano loops.

I also actively participate in the administration, management, and marketing of the company, creating marketing materials and reaching out to potential clients.
